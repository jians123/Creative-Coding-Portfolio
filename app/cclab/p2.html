        Design Process

        <p1
          >I built a size of 400*400px canvas with illustrator and made a
          draft of the face on it. The face was made up of redness around the
          eyes, and the nose shaped like stars. Then I sketched a curve to
          represent the mouth. The expression was innovative but simple. I did
          the largest and smallest faces separately, with the largest
          almost taking up the entire canvas. Then, in the most comprehensive
          face, I isolated the eyes, the star, the nose, and the mouth, exported
          them in PNG format, and imported them into p5.js. I altered some of
          the coordinates of the coordinate system to place the components in
          different spots. Then I changed the data in the random to modify the
          vibration amplitude of the face, which makes the entire product funny.
          However, what bothers me is that when I exported each individual
          component of the face into the P5JS, I had to adjust the data range of
          the instruction one by one. I configured various backdrop color to
          change automatically as the mouse moved randomly on the screen, which
          corresponds to the face's size shifting. In addition, I included some
          stars in my piece that will appear and burst on the screen when
          people press the right mouse button. This, I feel, is what
          distinguishes my work.</p1

          Reflection
        </h1>
        <p>
          I discovered some great and helpful techniques while working on this
          project dubbed "Face Generator." For example, by varying the data
          range and random data, I was able to change the form, size, and
          movement of the image. And the burst of stars was created by pressing
          the mouse. I hope that individuals who engage with my work have fun
          and pleasure when they see this humorous expression and click the
          right mouse button to relieve their pressure.
