        Proposal
      </h1>

      <div>
        <p>
          My bitmap game derives its inspiration from Lewis Caroll’s famous
          novel Alice in Wonderland. The game character is Alice herself when
          she finds herself shrinking in size after drinking a mysterious potion
          in a room. The design of the game space is thus based on that
          particular scene. In addition, the game borrows from the novel, and
          the contextual era it created in, to include many ornamentation of
          Victorian themes, such as flowers, furnitures etc I sketched. That
          scene where Alice is panicking and searching a cure anxiously upon
          seeing her body getting smaller somehow really struck me as a kid,
          even though I don’t remember all the details of the story. That’s the
          reason why I’ve used this scene as the creative background of my game.
          I believe it’s really fun to see an ip from fairy tales that everybody
          is familiar with set in a bitmap game.

          Game Description
        </h1>
        <p>
          Alice falls down the rabbit hole while chasing a hare with a pocket
          watch. Unexpectedly, she finds herself in a beautiful room and, out of
          curiosity, swallows a bottle of magical potion. Now Alice is
          shrinking! The opening frame of the game has floral decoration on all
          four sides and brief instructions on how to play the game, a quick
          “how to play” section. During the game, to prevent Alice from totally
          disappearing as she gets smaller, the player must use the four arrow
          keys to guide her to travel up, down, left, and right in order to
          obtain the potion, which will emerge at random spots during the game.
          The more potions Alice collects, the higher the score of each game
          will be, which is kept at the top of the screen. If Alice gets too
          small and vanishes, the game is over, which triggers the textual
          indicator “game over” and prompts the player to play the game again by
          pressing space.

          Reflection
        </h1>
        <p>
          For the design of this game, I drew a lot of inspiration from the
          well-known story of Alice in Wonderland and my own feelings of
          enchantment and curiosity upon first hearing about the magical and
          fantastical elements of the world as a child. I incorporated a number
          of Victorian ornaments as well as whimsical motifs that occurred in
          the story, in the design of the imagery that decorates the frames of
          the interface. In the opening frame, we see classical Victorian floral
          arrangements that is visually pleasing to the eye. In the gameplay, we
          see such elements as chairs, clocks, mushroom and poker soldiers etc.
          This visual design, along with the representation of the game
          character Alice, conveys a sense of elegance and more importantly
          playful wonderment. The sound design complements the visual design in
          creating a light-hearted playful mood. The score music in the opening
          frame is lively and melodious. During the game, a similar sound plays
          every time Alice obtains a new potion. Overall, the game is a
          light-hearted and whimsical one that employs a traditional reward and
          punishment system. The rapidly shrinking image of Alice creates a
          sense of urgency and motivates the player to quickly find new potions
          so as to avoid defeat. The disappearance of your game character is a
          direct and literal visual translation of failure in this game. On the
          other hand, the increase in size, as well as the increase in the score
          kept conspicuously at the top of the interface offer rewards that
          prompt the player to keep playing in hopes of getting a better score.
          This game is simple in its mechanism but very fun to play. It takes
          the player into a fantastical world, one that Alice finds herself in,
          where quirky and amazing things can happen.
