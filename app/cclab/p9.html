        <p>
          In the camera I designed, the interface is run through several steps.
          After entering into the web page, users can click on the right arrow
          in the top left corner and later an automatic pop-up box will ask for
          consent to turn on the camera. After receiving the users’ agreement,
          the web interface will be shown in Figure 1.0. At this page, if users
          move the cursor to the corresponding box marked red, they will be
          guided to hit the numbers 1-4 on the keyboard to run the camera and
          switch filters.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h1>
          Description
        </h1>
        <p>
          I designed the page to protect user privacy based on two
          considerations. The first point is, while many camera applications on
          the market only send a one-time privacy permission prompt, I choose to
          design a double authentication system, using a special box trigger and
          keyboard toggle to ensure that the camera will revert to the
          consentful interface once the users’ mouse is removed from the box,
          thus protecting the users’ privacy every time. Another point is
          considered in terms of typography, I design different font size, color
          and styles serving as background reminders. For instance, the most
          eye-catching part is a line of words encouraging users to authorize
          camera privacy, rather than hiding it in a large paragraph with small
          text. By marking red and enlarging the font size, the users’ awareness
          of privacy will be subconsciously enhanced.

          Reflection
        </h1>
        <p>
          In response to F.R.I.E.S, I mainly focused on both reversible and
          informed sides. Clear and suggestive explanations will be given to
          inform the user community about the information accessing to the
          camera. In addition, users are reminded of their rights to
          de-authorize the privacy permission to the camera at any time. The
          double verification approach may be relatively multi-step to use, but
          as a designer, I intended to convey my sincere and respectful attitude
          to protect user privacy. In designing the unconventional camera, I
          planned to balance the aesthetic diversity of the camera filters with
          the protection of user privacy. With the concept of the masses should
          be allowed to release from the societal aesthetic homogeneity and
          appreciate their imperfect selves, after redesigned the distorted
          mirror filter and created a new filter as the fourth option, I further
          transformed my idea into the consentful interface, conveying that all
          imperfections of users will be safely protected. In this way users are
          expected to feel reassured to use my camera and fully engage in their
          imaginative self-creations.
