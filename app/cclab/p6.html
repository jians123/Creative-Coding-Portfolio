          In this project, I plan to keep track of my drinking habits. In my
          daily life, I am quite fond of drinking. Part of the issue is that I
          workout a lot and am frequently thirsty. Another reason is that many
          individuals believe that drinking more water can increase my body's
          metabolism and improve my health. As a result, I started to keep track
          of my drinking habits.
        </p>

          I began recording my data on Last Wednesday and finished on Last
          Saturday. Every day between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., I recorded how many
          glasses of water I drank every hour on my phone. As a result, the
          numbered list I have documented are as follows: Wednesday
          =,0,0,2,0,4,1,2,3,1 [3]; Thursday =,1,0,1,3,2,2,1,2,0 [2]; Friday
          =,2,0,0,1,2,3,5,1,0 [3]; 1,3,0,4,2,1,2,0,1 Saturday = [0]. Each value
          in the array reflects the number of glasses of water I consumed during
          that hour of the experiment. In the p5js sketch, I created four rows
          of dancing balls. The balls indicate the overall frequency with which
          I drank water during the course of the four-day trial. I computed the
          average quantity of water I drank each day and came up with
          [1.6,1.4,1.7,1.4]. I changed the frequency of dancing to demonstrate
          the difference in daily water use.

          Because I needed to capture and visualize my data, I do not want to
          just enter the data into p5js, which would result in a dull product.
          To go in with the subject of "self-portrait," I used Photoshop to
          create a cartoon-style image of myself drinking. This may help to a
          better display of my "drinking water" habit. I took four rows of
          colorful balls, arranged them in an array, and positioned them in the
          location of "my" stomach. Their dance has the same frequency as water
          flowing. I wanted to mimic and accentuate the movement of drinking
          water by doing this.

          I discovered that by producing a data portrait, I can really
          accomplish something quite fascinating, which is to use ordinary and
          unnoticed data in my everyday life to create an engaging and appealing
          product. I never considered using everyday items to make products. My
          biggest takeaway from this endeavor is that it has encouraged me to
          pay attention to more fascinating and everyday topics. Aside from
          that, data visualization may be used to spark new ideas. I'll look for
          additional opportunities to do this. When it comes to my losses, one
          notable one is that I did not devote enough time to the project. This
          will be improved in future developments.
