        >I came up with the concept of making a tree-shaped clock. The tree
        changes over time. In the spring, the tree's blossoms open up. Summer is
        a great time to see the leaves grow. In the late fall, the tree bears
        fruit. The tree then goes dormant for the winter, with no fruits or
        leaves to show for its efforts. As a result, the seasons of the trees
        served as a visual representation of the 24 hours in a day. The spring
        tree represents the beginning of the day, or 0 o'clock. During the
        summer, it is common to wake up at six a.m. Autumn starts at 12 o'clock
        and ends at 18 o'clock. The tree's growth, from the time its blossoms
        bloom in the spring until the time all of its leaves fall off in the
        winter, may then disclose the day's time.</p1

        Fry eggs and the developing fetus in the mother's womb are the other two
        concepts I didn't end up adopting. I didn't use it for the first since I
        believed it was overused to utilize fried eggs to demonstrate the
        passage of time. I wanted to design a clock that could tell the time
        throughout the day. For the second, I didn't utilize it since it was
        difficult to determine which day of the fetus' development should be
        referenced. In addition, I discovered that using the seasons was a
        precise and straightforward method to display the passing of time during
        the day. There are four distinct seasons to the day.

        Since the if-else statement has a defined structure that permits
        instructions to be applied, this project taught me how to utilize it
        effectively. It's possible to transition from one picture to the next by
        clicking the mouse after the X and Y values are defined within an
        acceptable range. I split my 600x600px canvas into four equal halves.
        After that, I applied a transparent transition effect between the two
        photographs by reducing the change of season photos to 0.5 seconds. To
        my surprise, this effect only lasted for one round. If I tried to click
        the mouse to alternate between any two quarters after that initial
        round, the effect would disappear. The transition didn't loop until I
        used the bchanging instruction, which causes a transition to be created
        every time the mouse is clicked.
