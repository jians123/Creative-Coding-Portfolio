        Assignemnt Description
      </h1>

      <p1
        >Words and images help us recall the past. When we tell our friends
        about our recollections, our words often create an image in their minds.
        This image is their interpretation of our recollections, and it will
        certainly differ greatly from the image in our minds. Because, unlike a
        computer programming language, human language is incredibly vague. It is
        usually a rough estimate and approximative. Assignment 1 investigates
        ambiguity in human language as well as the difference between human and
        machine language. We can collaborate in couples of two and share
        comprehensive details of a personal thing we have lost in the past.
        Then, using the descriptions, we will recreate the objects in p5.js for
        our partners.</p1

        Design Information
      </h1>

      <p>
        This project is created by Shang Jiang. My partner is Hector Rodriguez
        Aguilar, and here is his description of the object:"When I was 2 years
        old I adored this stuffed rabbit called Peter the rabbit. The stuffed
        animal was shaped like a rabbit and he had an orange carrot attached to
        it.He is wearing a blue tiny jacket."

      <p>
        My partner described the rabbit he has lost in a vivid and casual way.
        He gave some details like the color and accessories. The rabbit is
        somehow, very funny and lovely. According to the description of him, I
        created an image of the rabbit. Firstly, I hand painted the rabbit I
        imagined and the image was mostly composed by circles and ellipse. I
        then transferred the drawing into the pseudocode. I disassembled the
        whole rabbit into parts in different shapes and used corresponding code
        instructions to complete the picture. For example, I create a circle at
        first, but then I edited the width and height to an oval ear. I input
        the “rotate” in order to change the Angle of the oval ear so that I
        created a mirror image of it. For the rest of the body, I first created
        the ones on the left, and then created the ones on the right by changing
        the height and width. When it comes to the differences in each
        interpreting process, I think I had made a lot of alterations when I am
        working on the rabbit. When I started with it, I wanted to draw a very
        sophisticated rabbit, but later I found that I could not achieve this by
        coding, because the image of the rabbit contains too many sophisticated
        and unregular shapes. Therefore, in the later process, I used some
        simple and fundamental shapes like the circle and ellipse. Then, I found
        I have to continually adjust the up and down in the. coordinate axis,
        which is a big challenge for me. I have tried for several times to
        achieve this.
