          I come from a traditional Chinese background, and I would like to
          choose lotus flower to present optical illusion. Lotus is linked with
          many of the pristine qualities that one would like to possess. Thus,
          over China's long history, many renowned poets have used lotus to
          combine it with other beautiful words to create a magnificent poetry
          that the Chinese have read for thousands of years. It has now become a
          part of Chinese culture.

          I picked a photograph of a real lotus blossom as my draft in order to
          produce a realistic and vibrant visual illusion. After that, I edited
          it in Photoshop. For example, I put some additional petals to the
          lotus to depict the process of the flower from closing to blossoming.
          I created some straight lines in the photo and subsequently covered it
          with a graphic made up of several black lines to clearly depict each
          stage of lotus development. The audience may experience the illusion
          of the lotus flower opening or shutting in the express as the black
          lines move back and forth.

          I didn't utilize any complex coding in this project. I just considered
          changing the track of the movement of the black lines picture after
          importing the photo of lotus with some lines and the picture of black
          lines into P5JS. Two variables were used: t and n. T indicates the
          change's starting value, which is 0. N is the amount that is added to
          T each time. I set n to 0.5 since I used 0.5 as a unit of measurement
          comparable to resolution ratio, therefore it should be divisible by
          600px. Because the black line travels horizontally, the x value in its
          coordinate axis should be changed to t. As a result, I wrote an if
          statement that causes the black lines to travel to the right when it
          starts playing, but when they reach the canvas edge, they begin to
          move to the left. In addition, I modified two functions: when the left
          mouse button is long pressed, the movement stops; when the mouse
          button is released, the movement resumes. Overall, because computer
          languages are so versatile, I believe logic is a critical component of
          generating animation effects using P5JS. It's the ideal option if you
          can accomplish your goals with few lines of code.
