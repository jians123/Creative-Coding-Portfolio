          I started by drawing a nun in Illustrator. I retained the nun's head,
          and the rest of her body was based on designs supplied by my
          teammates(Amanda,Aisha,Shayla). I merged these various body parts to
          create a one-of-a-kind "monster." I adjusted the rising speed of the
          balloons behind the nun to a user-defined value so that I may raise
          them with a mouse click. Also,as you press the mouse, the nun's mouth
          will continue to open and close as she is reciting a religious hymn.

          My Old Background Story
        </h1>
        <p>
          The nun was dressed in a black robe and a white turban, which seemed
          calm and elegant. A gray cross pendant lay quietly on the white piece
          of her chest. In Catholicism, the cross on the chest is a clothing
          accessory for the clergy of the monastery. This shows that her
          identity is unusual. However, her face was pale and her lips were
          blood red, giving a great visual impact. This will make people
          confused whether it is red lips or bloody mouth. Her eyes drooped and
          looked innocent, like a cute child. But the combination of the whole
          expression looks a little weird. Her calm face and big horrified eyes
          give people a sense of suppressed and unknown fear. She seemed to be
          staring at the person looking at her with pleading and fearful eyes.
          The combination of these elements makes her strange and complicated.
          This has to make people worry that her behavior and appearance will be
          very different.

          My New Background Story
        </h1>
        <p>
          As a whole, it can be seen that this is still a nun. Compared with the
          actual image of a nun, this nun uses the geometric concept of a
          natural image. For example, her head is round, her turban is square,
          and her limbs are rectangular. Compared to the photo capturing
          reality, the image of this nun is obviously more abstract and
          cartoonish. Her body is the morph of a dice, and her feet are the
          morph of a mobile phone holder. It is well known that the image of a
          nun is a black robe with a white mind. More colors on their bodies may
          be their red lips. With the combination and proportion of these three
          colors, it is interesting to abstract their bodies as dice. Finally,
          the white and red balloons behind the nun deepen the cartoonish Ness
          of the nun's image, because the balloons represent innocence.

          About Mr. Apple: I feel as though I tend to find myself surrounded by
          screens. My laptop sits directly in front of me while my phone rests
          beside it and my iPad plays music through my Bluetooth speaker. There
          are so many screens that I feel like sometimes people turn into them.
          Mr. Apple is a prime example, a screeny. He has three eyes from
          staring too intently at his technology (he had to add a third because
          two simply weren’t enough). His hair style is always in flux because
          it’s so versatile, all he has to do is think up a new one on the
          internet and wear it for a day. His shirts work the same way, as any
          image can become the newest fashion statement. Unless it involves
          buttons. Buttons are outdated. Side note, if the Wifi connection is
          really bad, he won’t be able to hear you very well. He gets that from
          all the Zoom calls. Lastly, we can’t forget his shoes. We all know how
          modern technology likes to walk all over USB-A's. Mr. Apple is a trend
          setter.

          My backstory: The dominox is a machine with a human concept. The
          numbers on the dominoes represent the number of features on what a
          human face would have, organs placed as a human would have, and the
          neck as an empty domino piece to represent that the machine has no
          voice therefore it can only express in actions. The philosophy behind
          Dominox is simple as it sounds; dominoes are built to collapse only to
          be built & collapse again in different forms. But because it is a
          machine with a human concept, the dominox is paired with a domino
          power bank to give it a machine driven power to bring itself to life
          every time it collapses.

          Reflection

        <p>
          I developed an intriguing addition to the "Stitched corpse" as a
          result of my work with my teammates. (I take Amanda's upper body,
          Shayla's lower body, and Aisha's balloon as the prop.) In line with
          the concept, I picked an unsettling but saintly music that lends the
          piece a holy air. I altered the parameters of the balloon, the nun's
          lips, and the crucifix behind her with a bespoke formula. This work
          has allowed me to investigate elements that I had never considered
          before.
