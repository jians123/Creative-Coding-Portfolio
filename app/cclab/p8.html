          In the selfie camera I designed, three filters with visual effects are
          created through coding. During the coding process, I was also engaged
          in an intense collision of thoughts, as well as the perception of
          artistic senses. In the era of epidemic, modern people are living in a
          more socially-networked way. Therefore, photos are a main carrier to
          convey human emotions and sense of belonging. In a sense, filters can
          condense one’s expectations to reflect a variety of internal worlds.
          Different from the usual filters, users will find three special
          filters when they are using the unconventional camera. Users can click
          the start button in the upper left corner, move the mouse right to
          canvas and then left click, and use keyboard 1, 2, or 3 to switch
          between filters. Each of the three filters has its own source of
          inspiration.

          Design Process

        <p>
          The first pixel filter is inspired by the Minecraft sandbox game. In
          three-dimensional space, players are free to create and destroy
          different kinds of cubes. Therefore, the filter is composed of retro
          pixels, allowing the user to roam in the world of imagination. Then,
          the main tone of the second filter is dark blue. The filter will add a
          more wonderful sense of rhythm to dynamic shots than still photos. My
          design was inspired by Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”, with its violet and
          blue hues, full of movement and changing starry sky. Finally, the
          third filter will distort portraits and objects, borrowing from the
          distorting mirror of childhood. In the world of Distorting Mirror,
          everything is spinning, and the circles seem to carry magic. The
          filter is covered with the innocence of children, but also tinged with
          the colors of adult worlds, seeming to be capable of illuminating the
          deepest thoughts in human heart. Each of the three filters has its own
          characteristics, therefore I applied all of them in the camera.

          Reflection
        </h1>
        <p>
          In designing the unconventional camera, I rethought the societal
          aesthetics from my personal aesthetics to the general public’s. When
          filters with beautifying effects have become a social necessity, are
          we users embracing a new freedom or bound by the software that makes
          it easy for us to achieve a “pretty face”? Perhaps it is the beauty
          filter that chooses the aesthetics for us, rather than the other way
          around. In the post-epidemic era, virtual socialization is becoming
          the new norm. We need to shake off the shackle of aesthetic
          homogenization, embrace individual diversity, and accept our own
          imperfections. Therefore, in designing the unconventional camera, I
          appreciate the bold imagination and originality I put in coding them.
          The filter, as a rare self-expression, is a way to review the past and
          look into the future. Whether to choose a filter for life, it is up to
          every one of us to decide.
