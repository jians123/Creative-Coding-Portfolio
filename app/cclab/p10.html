        Design Process
      </h1>

      <div>
        <p>
          I’ve decided to utilise one of the weathers forecast website that
          based in New York City as my API source for this project. Main reason
          being similar applications are widely used by most of the smartphone
          users to check on the weather, so I thought to create one creative
          tool that can be used to monitor the weather conditions anytime. In
          the preview page, we can check on some basic information about the
          weather, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure and wind speed.
          This is quite different from the original API address where more
          details such as whether its light rain, moderate rain or heavy rain
          can be seen from the website. I’ve simplified that info in this
          project so that users can obtain only the essential info they need
          daily. Besides that, I’ve also created some customised icons on the
          preview page. To bring a sense of fun to the users, I’ve designed a
          cute bear where it’s face will follow the movement of the cursor. This
          design intends to reach out to more younger users where they can
          interact with the bear while checking the weather. Moreover, I’ve also
          created six icons to represent different weather conditions, including
          cloudy day, mild rain, sunny day, snowing day, hazy day and thunder
          day. On top of that, the interface is very easy for the user to use.
          For example, they can just scroll to the icon “temperature” and the
          temperature will appear in the dialogue box. Likewise for another
          three icons where users can just point to them, and the info will
          appear accordingly.

          Main reason I’m choosing the API of weather report is because I think
          the dataset positioned themselves well as an API source, and thus all
          the info inside is user friendly and enable us to obtain any key info
          that is needed from the source. And I'm creating a weather
          surveillance tool because I think that it is something most of the
          people will use daily. However, nowadays different applications or
          websites are providing too much information for the users which I
          sometimes think is unnecessary. For example, those apps will provide
          detailed info such as the UV rate of sunlight of each hour. Yet I
          think most users will only need to know whether it’s a sunny day or
          not to decide what they want to wear for the day. So Im hoping to
          provide this sense of simplicity back to the users. That’s the reason
          I only created 4 weather criteria for the users to check on, which is
          temperature, humidity, air pressure and wind speed respectively. I
          believe these are sufficient for majority of the users who check on
          weather conditions every day.

          Reflection
        </h1>
        <p>
          If I have more time to work on this project, I would like to obtain
          more input from the potential users of my tool and check if they are
          satisfied with it or if they actually prefer something fancier. I
          would dedicate the extra time to conduct a survey, since after all
          user experience is something, I value the most in this project. As for
          the learnings, I think one major point I can share is that the whole
          idea of API is something really fascinating as it allows different
          people to utilise one source to create something else. There are lots
          of flexibilities in this idea and thus lots of potentials to create
          something great. Therefore, my next steps are to check on different
          API sources to obtain more knowledge about it. And hopefully after
          that I can get some new ideas to create something else which can be
          shared widely.
