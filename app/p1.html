          "Happy," "New," and "Year" are the terms I've picked. Because I am now
          celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year, which is a highly important
          celebration in China, I picked these phrases. As a result, when I was
          given the task, I decided to use these lines to express my hope for
          the new year, which is to come across things that will make me happy
          this year and to start fresh.

          Joy is a great sensation that comes to mind when you hear the word
          "Happy." People are glad when they come across items that might make
          them joyful, like as winning a game or being admitted to their
          preferred institution. When you click the mouse, the enormous and
          little letters of "Happy" falls heavily to the ground in my design. It
          implies that the things that satisfy you might appear in unexpected
          ways, such as "Happy" and suprise unexpectedly coming to you.

          The term "New" refers to anything that has never existed before.
          People are frequently surprised and perplexed by new things. The
          phrases in red or white in my design emerge from the depths and move
          towards the foreground against a black background.(The color scheme is
          inspired by The New School logo) It provides the spectator an
          impression of being in a contemporary, crowded environment. This is
          extremely similar to how individuals felt when they first encountered
          something new. They will be dazzled since they are unsure how to deal
          with the new situations. At the same time, kids experience a certain
          type of beauty and excitement that comes with "new" things.

        <p>
          The term "Year" is used to indicate the passage of time. A year is a
          fixed span of time. A year will be followed by another, in a sort of
          cyclical pattern. This attitude is reflected in my design. The large
          white "Year" in the first and third lines, as well as in "earyea,"
          indicates that a year follows a year. Then there are little letters
          arranged in a spiral pattern. The spiral rotates, much like time does,
          yet it is always a spiral, never ending and repeated. This might
          demonstrate the philosophy of infinite time. All of the elements in
          this image are dynamic, implying that time is continually moving by
          and that one year will be rapidly replaced by another.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          I've gained a better grasp of typography as a result of this project.
          We now employ technology to create new words. It's a contemporary
          approach, yet ideas are always at the heart of design. I have to tie
          my design to the meaning of the phrase while designing typography,
          which needs ingenuity. I've also witnessed the wonders of technology.
          The design process may be made more productive and engaging by using
          the modular and parameterized paradigm.
