      <div>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          My handmade website was inspired by the poem "The Road Not Taken."
          This poem initially appeared in my basic school Chinese textbook. I
          was a naive youngster at the time, and I had no idea what the title of
          this poem meant. Despite the fact that it was just used as some
          beautiful sentences on the title page of a chapter, I was blown away
          by its appeal. I became increasingly drawn to this poetry as I grew
          older and realized its tremendous significance and implication. At the
          age of 38, the author Robert Frost left his comfortable and secure
          teaching job to devote his time to creating poetry. "Write poetry, if
          you're poor, you're poor," he added. His life is depicted in The Road
          Not Taken. Choosing one route necessitates the exclusion of another.
          Diverse decisions result in different lifestyles. What if the road
          ahead is full with thorns and bumps for the beloved and the ideal
          hidden in the heart? You can only live your style if you follow your
          inner need.

        <h1>Working Progress</h1>
        <p>
          According to the rich philosophy, I built two roads based on the
          content in the poem, each signifying a fork in the path of a long
          life. Users can select the next interface to access based on their
          preferences. Following your selection, the interface will provide two
          distinct forms of road instructions. I created two diametrically
          opposed interactive scenarios to reflect the various sights along the
          trip on separate highways. The first option is an open avenue covered
          in golden leaves, which provides people with a relaxed and comfortable
          tranquil delight; the second option is a lush and quiet route lighted
          by firefly, which entices people to explore deeper surroundings.
          Despite their differing features, these two roads are gorgeous and
          flat, just asking for me to stomp. However, regardless of which option
          you choose, whether the landscape along the road is magnificent or
          light, users will finally arrive at the same joyful conclusion
          surrounded by trees and flowers. This also represents the poem's
          deeper meaning: in real life, persons at the complete intersection
          will undoubtedly feel the swing and wandering of decision, but as long
          as they make their own choice, they will have no regrets.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          By creating this interactive website, I've gained a stronger and more
          self-aware grasp of the link between choice and life. What I focus on
          in the process of creating the tableau of the two roads is how to
          portray the commonality and distinctiveness of the two roads via the
          comparison of interface design. I hope to accomplish the impact of
          allowing people to eventually end with an immersive tangled feeling.
          We can have a better knowledge of the connotation of poetry as a
          result of this encounter. The notion of achieving the same beautiful
          end through varied ways, as well as the superiority of experience, is
          reflected in reaching the same beautiful conclusion.
