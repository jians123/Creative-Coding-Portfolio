        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          I created 6 different classes of gestures to generate 6 different
          music melodies. The main purpose of my work is to combine human
          gestures with music. It will recognize the speed, orientation, front
          and back of different gestures, and play different music and video
          effects. In the future, Teachable Machine will further recognize more
          complex human gestures, such human body movements, and combine these
          movements to play various musical instrument melodies. With this tool,
          people will not have to concern about what music and video effects to
          choose, they can randomly create their own simple favorite movements
          and just leave the complex creative process to the tool. Therefore,
          the purpose of this project is to allow people to be musicians or
          dancers anytime, anywhere.

        <h1>Working Progress</h1>
        <p>
          I have shown several demos to my peer, and we have found two main
          issues on my tool: 1) The accuracy of tool gestures recognition. 2)
          The lack of richness on canvas display. In order to solve First
          issues, I improved the recognition of my gestures in machine learning
          tool. A slow-motion camera will be used, which can capture 240 photos
          per second, to capture the details of my every gesture to make the
          system clearly recognize the changes of gestures. In addition, I have
          to change the wrist joints. The direction of rotation and the motion
          of waving, and distinguish between two hands and one hand to increase
          the accuracy of tool gestures recognition. For the lack of canvas
          display, I also improved the visual effects, and made a greater
          distinction between the appearance of the graphics on the canvas, such
          as different colors, sizes of bars, and numbers of appearances. As a
          result, various visuals can make the tool more interesting and easier
          to interact.

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          Even though there is a good demonstration of the functionality of the
          teachable machine tool, but the it is very sensitive to the
          surrounding user's environment, because this tool is only captured by
          recording static pictures of gesture changes with the white
          background, so although I did a lot of testing as well as the
          improvement. However, the only issue is that if the background behind
          the user is not white since the system only recognizes white walls,
          some gesture changes will not be detected very well, resulting in a
          bit of confusion in the music variations. Therefore, in order to
          prevent tool effects by the user's background, I will improve the
          recognition and positioning of the tool's algorithm for gestures, by
          blurring the user's background to enhance the depth of field effect,
          and reduce the impact of the background to increase the accuracy of
          the tool.
